## About
Tin Drum was created to my personal usage after years of frustratingly trying to manage my text styles. I used to use Styles Generator combined with Rename-It.
Tin Drums creates styles in the following format:

```{ Layer Name } / { Alignment } / { Color }```

Since developing a UI for Sketch plugins is a mess I haven't created any UI. Right now, in order to add or edit the colors, it has to be done programatically. And that's why I'm planning on slowly but surely developing the perfect UI for the plugin, and I would love to hear your thoughts! So please send suggestions, congratulations and complaints to:
