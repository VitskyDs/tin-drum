## About
Tin Drum was created for my personal use after years of frustratingly trying to manage my text styles. I used to use Styles Generator combined with Rename-It.
Tin Drums creates styles in the following format:

```{ Layer Name } / { Alignment } / { Color }```

Slowly but surely I will be developing the perfect UI for the plugin, and I would love to hear your thoughts! So please send suggestions, congratulations and complaints to:
