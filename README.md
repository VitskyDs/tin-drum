# Tin Drum
Tin Drum is a Sketch plugin that helps you create you typography system fast.

Tin Drum uses the selected text layers as your future styles. Then, it collects your Document Colors and creates a text layer for each selected alignment.

In "scientific" terms, this is what happens: (Text Layer × Colors × Alignment) × number of Text Layers.

## About
Tin Drum was created for my personal use after years of frustratingly trying to manage my text styles. I used to use Styles Generator combined with Rename-It.

Tin Drums creates styles in the following format:

```{ Layer Name } / { Alignment } / { Color }```

Slowly but surely I will be developing the perfect UI for the plugin, and I would love to hear your thoughts! So please send suggestions, congratulations and complaints to:
